To run:

* Create a distribute-based virtualenv.
* Checkout this source into the venv, say, in a folder called @src@.
* Run the @./install.sh@ script to install dependancies.
* Ensure MongoDB is running (without password protection) and run @./init.py@ to create the model and populate the default data.
* Run @./cron.py@ once to get started.  Optionally set up a half-hour cron job to run this script.
* Run @./application.py@ to start the web server on port 8080.
